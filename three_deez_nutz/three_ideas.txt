## Idea 1: 3D Printing - Neural Net
```
Crawl websites for .stl files, pictures, and labels. Pull matrix data into
numpy via stl.Mesh and run through neural net to predict label of 3D printed
model.

*OR*

Combine with image of design. Give computer image and ask it to draw 3D design?

*OR*

Run neural net backwards to generate 3D design from words?

- Could be overly complex and/or computationally expensive
- Free designs are usually strange objects. e.g. sculptures/charicatures
```

## Idea 2: Weld County Landman
```
Obtained corporate sponsorship from Denver Oil & Gas company to access Weld
Count Clerk & Recorder Website (check). Crawl website and download .pdf files of
Oil & Gas Leases. Pull language from .pdf files and run through NLP to determine
terms of lease. Supplement with COGCC data to find leases that are expired and
not produced upon (leases expire based on contract terms if not produced upon).
Buy leases that are expired and sell back to Oil & Gas companies at premium
-> profit.

- having difficulty reading some pdfs in. Words are jumbled and/or concatenated
```

## Idea 3: Colorado Oil & Gas Production
```
Crawl COGCC website for production and geospatial data. Find areas that are
outliers -> exploit -> profit

- kinda boring
```
