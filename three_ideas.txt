## Idea 1: 3D Printing - Neural Net
Crawl websites for .stl files and labels. Pull matrix data into numpy via
stl.Mesh and run through neural net to predict label of 3D printed model.
Could be used to classify 3d printed items to comply with regulations?
Run neural net backwards to generate 3D blueprints from words?

## Idea 2: Weld County Landman
Obtained corporate sponsorship from Denver Oil & Gas company to access Weld
Count Clerk & Recorder Website. Crawl website and download .pdf files of
Oil & Gas Leases. Pull language from .pdf files and run through NLP to determine
terms of lease. Supplement with COGCC data to find leases that are expired and
not produced upon (leases expire based on contract terms if not produced upon).
Buy leases that are expired and sell back to Oil & Gas companies at premium
-> profit.

## Idea 3: Colorado Oil & Gas Production
Crawl COGCC website for production and geospatial data. Find areas that are
outliers and exploit -> profit
